## FRC team #1977: *The Powersquids*

We're a medium sized FRC team operating out of Loveland High School since 2005!

We currently code with `The noose in the storage closet` and have lots of fun while doing so!

<?php
$randomThings = array(
    'random thing 1',    
    'random thing 2',    
    'random thing 3',    
    'random thing 4',    
    'random thing 5',    
    'random thing 6',    
    'random thing 7 ',    
);
echo $randomThings[mt_rand(0,count($randomThings)-1)];
